# Newtons Rocket
Newtons Rocket is a simple physics game that helps you understand and visualize the Laws of Motion.

- Change the variables in the F = MA equation
- See how that changes the distance/time graph
- Launch the rocket into space!

This is intended as an introduction to help visualization of Force = Mass * Acceleration
